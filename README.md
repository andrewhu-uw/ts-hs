# TS-HS: a TypeScript compiler written in Haskell

Just a cool project I'm working on to learn Haskell, parser combinators, and TypeScript

## Structure

`Parser.hs` has a function `runParser` that you can use to test parse different segments of code

## TODO

 - Add single quote string constants
 - Add comment support
